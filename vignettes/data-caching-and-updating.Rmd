The "pkgmatch" package package relies on pre-generated [Language Model (LM)
embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding). Inputs of text,
code, or entire packages are converted into embeddings, and the results
compared with the pre-generated embeddings to discern the best-matching result.
The pre-generated embeddings are calculated for the entire package suites of
both [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/packages) and
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).

These package suites are constantly changing, and therefore the embeddings also
need to be regularly updated. The "pkgmatch" package includes several files in
the `/R` directory prefixed with "data-update" containing functions which
implement this updating. These functions are intended to be used only by the
developers
