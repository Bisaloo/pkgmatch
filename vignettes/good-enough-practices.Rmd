This document suggests minimal "Good-enough Practices" for software packages
which rely on LLM outputs.

1. Prefer local LLMs, for reasons described in [this separate
   vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgmatch/articles/why-local-llms.html),
    and generally avoid relying on closed or commercial APIs.
2. Provide direct links to all models used, such as through links to
    [huggingface model pages](https://huggingface.co/models), "Model cards"
    hosted elsewhere, or original published research. Include explicit
    statements about long-term availability and stability of all models.
3. Summarise the training data used in all models, including estimation of the
    proportion of data drawn from public domains, and the extent to which use of
    such data in model training may violate licensing conditions.
4. Combine LLM output with equivalent output from alternative algorithms.
    Reasons for this are exemplified in [this blog post from
    `anthropic.ai`](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval).
5. Use or implement efficient algorithms to combine ranks, including separate
    pre-processing of the most computationally intensive stages.
6. For very large corpora, use efficient dimensionality-reduction algorithms
    such as ["Annoy"](https://github.com/spotify/annoy).
7. Provide a "Summary" of how the software generates results. This should
    include the following sections where applicable:
      - Input chunking, describing chunking methods used, and possible user control
      - LLM sizes, including input or context size, and ouput or embedding sizes
      - Similarity algorithms, including metrics applied to LLM outputs, and
          metrics for alternative, non-LLM algorithms
      - Final ranking, including description of how different components are
        combined, such as outputs from different LLM chunks and from
        alternative, non-LLM algorithms. Tie-breaking procedures may also be
        described.
      - Reproducibility statement, including descriptions of any components
        relying on random numbers, and how seeding can be used to generate
        reproducible outputs.
8. Software should also provide more extended and non-technical descriptions of
   all aspects presented in the previous summary.
